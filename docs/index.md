This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to Sikuli Slides. It covers topics such as installation, creating and executing slides, and using Sikuli Slides' API in your own programs.

## What is Sikuli Slides?

Sikuli Slides turn presentation slides into executable programs for automating graphical user interfaces (GUI). A typical Sikuli Slide contains <b>a screenshot</b> and <b>a set of annotations</b>. The screenshot can be of any part of a user interface, such as a button, a group of buttons, a form, a dialog box, a window, or the entire desktop. The annotations are boxes to indicate targets and text boxes to indicate actions to be performed on the targets.

## Who can benefit?

If you are a <b>QA engineer</b>, you may be already creating slides with a series of screenshots to describe a test plan. Now the same slides can be executed directly on a live interface. If you work as a <b>tech support</b>, you may be already creating slides with a series of screenshots as how-to tutorials for the users in your organization. Now the same slides can be executed directly on users' live interfaces.
